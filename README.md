# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

## Project Description

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes and can lead to blindness if left untreated. This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. By automating the detection process, the model assists in early diagnosis and treatment, reducing the risks associated with delayed intervention.

The project focuses on:
- Preprocessing retinal images to improve feature detection.
- Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification.
- Implementing image augmentation to handle data scarcity and improve model robustness.

The model is trained on publicly available datasets, such as the Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy dataset, and aims to classify images into different stages of DR.

# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

## Overview
Diabetic Retinopathy Detection is a deep learning-based project designed to assist in the early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy by analyzing retinal images. The goal is to automate the detection process, enabling healthcare professionals to focus on patient care while reducing the risk of human error.

## Features
- Preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and standardizing retinal images.
- Use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification.
- Image augmentation techniques to enhance data diversity.
- Multi-class classification of diabetic retinopathy stages.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JoySeedhe/Diabetic-Retinopathy-detection.git
   cd Diabetic-Retinopathy-detection
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset

The model uses the Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy dataset, which can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data).

- Place the dataset in a `data/` folder within the project directory.
- The folder structure should be:
  ```plaintext
  data/
  ├── train/
  ├── test/
  └── labels.csv
  ```

## Usage

1. Preprocess the data:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

4. Make predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image <path_to_image>
   ```

## Model Architecture

The project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with the following key components:
- Pre-trained base model (e.g., VGG16 or ResNet) for feature extraction.
- Custom fully connected layers for classification.
- Softmax activation for multi-class classification.

## Results

- **Accuracy**: 89

Sample visualizations of model predictions are included in the `results/` folder.
